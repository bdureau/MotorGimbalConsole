<h1>eByte Lora E220 module configuration</h1>
<p>In order to do long range telemetry you will need to replace your bluetooth module by
    a long range telemetry module such as the Lora E22O.</p>
<p>The following modules have been successfully configured</p>
<p>E220-400T30D</p>
<p>E220-400T30S</p>
<p>E220-900T30D</p>
<p>E220-900T30S</p>
<p>E220-400T22D</p>
<p>etc ...</p>

<p> </p>
<p>To program the module you need a TTL cable</p>

<p>a USB adapter (USBC or micro USB depending on your Android device)</p>
<p><img  src="file:///android_asset/help/images/usb_adpter-small.jpg"/></p>
<p>a jst adapter and some jst cables are required</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note that your Android device battery must be strong enought to power the Lora module. Consider using
    an external battery if you have a powerfull module</p>
<p></p>
<p>In order to enter the configuration mode you will need to put both jumpers</p>
<p>You will need to configure the module so that it works with your altimeter board.</p>
<p>Note that those modules usually come pre-set to work at 57600 bauds. However your altimeter board
    by default will work at 38400 bauds so will need to make sure that you are connecting at the correct speed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note that Lora modules comes in pair so you will need to configure both the transmitter and receiver</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">CAUTION: make sure that you do not unplug the module while doing the following</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Retrieving the module configuration</strong></p>
<p>Plug the module in your Android device using an OTG cable or any USB adaptor that can work with
    micro USB or type C USB</p>
<p>Then click on [retrieve cfg] this will try to connect to the module using 9600 baud.
    It will then retrieve the module config so that you can change it.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Saving the module configuration</strong></p>
<p>Change the settings that you want to change. Make sure that you have selected a baudrate that will
    work with your board (by default 38400). Make sure that the channels are the same for the transmitter
    and receiver. If you set an encryption key make sure it is the same on both. When done click [Save cfg].
    This will save the configuration.
    If any error occur while saving it will abort the save</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note that you will need to repeat the same step for each module</p>
<p>Before you use it make sure you remove both jumpers to exit the configuration mode</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lora telemetry modules currently do not work with ESP32 board.</p>
